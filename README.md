# ETF RoboAdvisor: AWS Lex & Lambda
### Project #2, UNCC/Trilogy Education Services *FinTech Bootcamp*

According to a 2016 [poll](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatbots-vs-humans-for-customer-relations-2016-12), 44% of 18 - 65 year old users preferred interacting with chatbots over humans for standard customer relationship management (CRM) situations. As young adults continue to acquire customer market share, it is presumed this number has risen steadily since. Of course, market share gains come alongside income growth, which tends to be when people start to think about growing their wealth.

Studies abound of Gen Z's (and certain Milleanials') aversion to human interaction when it comes to routine tasks as compared with older generations. Discussing financial matters with an advisor can be daunting to anyone, but the market's fastest-growing consumer section expresses this quite clearly. A prime example is the average age of a Robinhood account owner, which is significantly lower than that of the average advisor-managed account holder. 

Given these facts, we have developed a chatbot to recommend ETF holdings to interested investors, which will likely be Gen Zers and Millenials. ETFs have the benefit of mitigating the risk that comes with selecting a handful of individual stocks when on a limited budget (again, a young investor trait. Specifically, our bot recommends SPDR industry ETFs, as they are widely reported on and easier to grasp for new investors. Our bot inquires as to the user's investment period, risk appetite, and return goals, among other things.
